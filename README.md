# qs-java-boot-junit-cucumber

A quick start project for **Java 8**, **Spring Boot** project, **Junit 5** for Unit tests and **Cucumber** for Behaviour driven development setup using **Maven** project.  

This uses **Spring Data JPA**, **H2 database** for persistence.  

This project also contains some basic code structure for a typical Spring Boot n-tier application.

If you want to have Cucumber setup in your application, just download / clone the project as starting point and start with your development.  

I have added a sample Cucumber feature file in `src/test/resources` -> `EndToEndTest.feature`.  

You can add more feature files in that location, and they will be picked by `CucumberTest`.

To run cucumber test, right click on feature file and in Spring STS, `Run as` -> `Cucumber feature`.  

Feel free to send suggestions or contribute to this repository.

Happy Coding
